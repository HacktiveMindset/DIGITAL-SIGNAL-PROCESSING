## Unit I: Discrete-Time Signals and Systems

### Introduction to DSP

* **Digital Signal Processing (DSP):** The processing of digital signals using digital circuits.
* **Advantages of DSP:**
    * Flexibility: Can be easily modified and adapted to different applications.
    * Accuracy: Can achieve high levels of precision and accuracy.
    * Reliability: Less susceptible to noise and interference compared to analog systems.
    * Cost-effectiveness: Can be implemented using low-cost microcontrollers and DSP chips.

### Basic Elements of a DSP System

* **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):** Converts analog signals into digital signals.
* **Digital Signal Processor (DSP):** Performs the actual processing of the digital signal.
* **Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC):** Converts digital signals back into analog signals (if necessary).

### Sampling Theorem

* **Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem:** States that a continuous-time signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling frequency is at least twice the maximum frequency component of the signal.
* **Aliasing:** The phenomenon that occurs when a signal is sampled at a frequency lower than the Nyquist rate, resulting in distortion of the reconstructed signal.

### A/D and D/A Conversion

* **A/D Conversion:** The process of converting an analog signal into a digital signal.
* **D/A Conversion:** The process of converting a digital signal into an analog signal.
* **Quantization:** The process of representing a continuous-valued signal with a finite set of discrete values.

### Elementary Discrete-Time Sequences

* **Unit Impulse Sequence:** A sequence that is 1 at n=0 and 0 otherwise.
* **Unit Step Sequence:** A sequence that is 1 for n>=0 and 0 otherwise.
* **Ramp Sequence:** A sequence that is n for n>=0 and 0 otherwise.
* **Exponential Sequence:** A sequence of the form a^n, where a is a complex number.

### Discrete-Time Systems

* **Description:** A mathematical model that relates the input sequence to the output sequence of a system.
* **Representation:** Can be represented by difference equations, impulse response, or transfer function.
* **Classification:**
    * **Linear:** Satisfies the superposition principle.
    * **Time-Invariant:** The output does not depend on the time at which the input is applied.
    * **Static:** The output at any time depends only on the input at that time.
    * **Causal:** The output at any time depends only on the input at that time and previous times.
    * **Stable:** Bounded input produces bounded output.
